2024 is my last year in college. I will be graduating in June 21st 2024, and that means that I will be entering my professional career. Therefore, I think the first half of the year is extremely important to hone skills that will help me start my professional life with the right foot. 

As I currently stand, I have high chances of getting hired in Oracle for a full time position. While this is a great way to get into the industry, my career long-term goals require for me to get a job in the US. Considering that the barrier to entry into the US tech-industry is high, I must focus on getting the required skills to become a candidate for these positions. 

Reflecting on my current skills for my career, I believe I'm not yet qualified for the highly sought-after positions. I have compared my resume to those that have actually achieved it and mine's just not enough compared to their accolades. However, I think I have identified the areas that separate them from my cv. The three most important categories:

1. 💼 **Projects**: Most of the best resumes I've seen showcase complex projects, outside school projects, that showcase their interest in the field. Topics like [[Artificial Intelligence]], [[Machine learning]], [[Cloud computing]] are quite popular nowadays. This is definitely something i must focus on. It will me to improve my programming skills, learn new technologies and show what I am capable of. Im about to write [[topic]] 

3. 🧑‍💻 **Hackathons**: Most candidates have at least participated in a hackathon before. I think it demonstrates their passion for programming, as well as the creativity to build something new out of scratch. Moreover, it is a great opportunity to improve my social skills as most of the competitions are team-based. I've read you can get assigned to a random team if you don't come up with one prior. Even though I don't want to do it, It will help me to become more social, lose shyness and become a better teammate.

- [x] 👾 **Competitive Programming**: A lot of resumes list their participations on programming competitions, such as ICPC or Math/Informatics olympiads. It shows their high proficiency in algorithmic thinking. Personally, I'm not keen to competitive programming, such I must work harder in other areas to makeup for this lack of interest.
