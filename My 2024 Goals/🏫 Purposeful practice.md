A purposeful practice is: 
- **Specific**: It should way well defined goals. The practice session should focus on improving one specific area towards a bigger goal.
- **Focused**: During a practice, all your focus must be on it. Avoid distractions.
- **Challenging**: Whatever you're practicing on should be out of your comfort zone. Don't practice on things you already know what to do.
- **Feed back**: Feedback should be provided to identity areas of improvement and track progress.
